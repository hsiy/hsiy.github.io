                <h1>K-12 CS Activities</h1>
                <p>I have worked with middle and high school teachers since 2011 to understand the factors that support or impede the introduction of CS classes in pre-college settings. With my background in software engineering, I am interested in getting pre-college students to take the first step towards eventually becoming proficient software engineers.   </p>
                <p>I am involved in the following activities. Click on the links to get more information about each one.</p>
                
                <h2>ITEST SPARCS</h2>
                <p>I am the Principal Investigator of <a href="http://cist.unomaha.edu/sparcs">Strategic Problem-based Approach to Rouse Computer Science (SPARCS)</a>, a project that aims to train middle school teachers in CS. It is funded by NSF under the ITEST program. This <a href="http://stemforall2018.videohall.com/presentations/1243">short video</a> explains the program in 3 minutes.</p>
                
                <h2>Research Experiences for Teachers</h2>
                <p>I have served on two NSF-funded programs on Research Experiences for Teachers in Computer Science. Our latest program is titled <a href="http://cist.unomaha.edu/wrist">Wearable Research for In-service STEM Teachers (WRIST)</a>. This program exposes high school teachers to CS research over a 6-week summer session and helps them to translate that experience into interesting classroom learning opportunities.</p>
                
                <h2>Google CS4HS</h2>
                <p>I have helped run several <a href="http://www.ist.unomaha.edu/cs4hs">summer teacher professional development workshops</a> funded by Google's CS4HS program. These short workshops enabled us to reach a larger set of teachers, and in many cases, served as a springboard for teachers to get into longer professional development programs such as SPARCS and RET.</p>
                
                <h2>MS CS Education</h2>
                <p>I have taught courses under UNOâ€™s new <a href="https://www.unomaha.edu/college-of-information-science-and-technology/computer-science-education/graduate/ms-csed.php">MS in Computer Science Education</a> degree. Students in these program are mostly in-service teachers. The MSCSEd program is the culmination of UNO's formal <a href="https://www.unomaha.edu/college-of-information-science-and-technology/computer-science-education/">CS Teacher Education pathway</a>, which also includes an IT Supplemental Endorsement (for Nebraska teachers only) and a Graduate Certificate in Computer Science. </p>
                
                <h2>Omaha CSTA</h2>
                <p>I am a founding member of Nebraska's <a href="https://www.csteachers.org/members/group.aspx?id=183539">Metro Omaha Computer Science Teachers Association (CSTA) chapter</a>, which started in 2013. This organization supports teachers who are interested in CS across the state of Nebraska, and serves as a networking opportunity for these teachers who often find themselves the lone CS person in their school building. I continue to serve as a university liaison. </p>
                
                <h2>UNO CSEdWeek</h2>
                <p>I help organize UNO's annual <a href="https://www.unomaha.edu/college-of-information-science-and-technology/computer-science/community-engagement/cs-education-week.php">CS Education Week</a> events. CSEdWeek highlights the contributions computer science makes to society and is an excellent opportunity to introduce pre-college students to Computer Science. The highlight of our CSEdWeek is the <a href="http://www.ist.unomaha.edu/CSBOWL">High School CS Challenge</a>. </p>
