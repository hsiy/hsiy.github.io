<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The course focuses on the engineering and development of real-world software products. It provides a pragmatic introduction into the fundamentals of software engineering. Basics of software project management are presented and are practiced in the term project.</p>
<h2>Learning Objectives</h2>
<p>Students who complete this course will:</p>
<ul>
<li>have knowledge of process, methods, tools used in the software engineering profession,</li>
<li>be familiar with concepts of software engineering project management,</li>
<li>be able to apply the lessons learned to real-world software projects.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Course content:</h2>
<ol>
<li>Overview and motivations</li>
<li>Requirements analysis</li>
<li>Software design</li>
<li>Verification and Validation</li>
<li>Software evolution</li>
<li>Project management</li>
<li>Advanced topics</li>
</ol>

<h3>How the hybrid course works</h3>
We will meet every Thursday until August 9. The meeting times will primarily be used for class discussions as well as project discussions. To prepare for class discussions, the lecture materials will be uploaded and students will be expected to read them before the next meeting. Expect to spend at least 2 hours per week doing the online readings and exercises.

<h3>Lectures slides</h3>
<p>The lecture slides will mostly come from the Sommerville textbook's companion website plus a few changes of my own.
The originals can be downloaded from <a href="http://iansommerville.com/software-engineering-book/" target="_blank">companion website</a></p>
<p>Some lectures will also be taken from Fox and Patterson (aka ESaaS book) and Bruegge and Dutoit (aka OOSE book).</p>
<p>The lecture slides will be posted on Canvas.</p>
