<h2>Course Description:</h2>
<div class="section">

Designed to introduce students to advanced object technology and other modern methodologies for developing software systems. Intended for graduate students who have mastered the basic concepts and issues of software engineering. Course covers advanced object-oriented software development. The course also covers several offshoots of object technology, including: component-based software engineering, aspect-oriented software development, model-driven software development, software product line engineering, service-oriented computing, generative programming, etc.

<h2>Evaluation</h2>
<div class="section">

Students will be evaluated as follows:

<table border=1>
<tr><td>Exams (midterm and final)</td><td align="right"> 40% </td></tr>
<tr><td>Projects and papers</td><td align="right"> 50% </td></tr>
<tr><td>Homeworks</td><td align="right"> 5% </td></tr>

</div>

<h2>Approximate exam dates</h2>
<div class="section">

<ol>
<li> Midterm - TBA
<li> Final - TBA
</ol>

</div>

<h2>Projects and Papers</h2>
<div class="section">

Projects and papers will be given to extend the students' learning experience beyond just class lectures. These consists of student presentations, projects, and a term paper.

<h3> Student presentations </h3>
<div class="section">

Throughout the semester, there will be several student presentations and development projects. Each student will be expected to give a presentation, which can either be a technology briefing or research paper discussion. 

<h4> Technology briefings </h4>
<div class="section">
A technology briefing gives an overview of a current software development technology relevant to the top being discussed in the lecture. For example, when we discuss object-relational mapping, some appropriate related technologies are EJB, Hibernate, etc. Students can volunteer to present an introduction to, say, EJB.  Note that a student wishing to make a technology briefing <b>must</b> have professional experience with that technology. I will be providing a list of <a href="techs.html">technology areas</a> and approximate dates when each area will be covered.
</div>


<h4> Research paper presentations </h4>
<div class="section">
Alternately, students can also present for discussion the results of an acceptable research paper from a relevant journal or conference. I will be providing a list of <a href="respapers.html">papers</a> you can choose from.
</div>

</div>

<h3>Projects</h3>
<div class="section">

There will also be 3-4 development projects which will put into practice the software development principles from the course. Students can work individually or in pairs. 
</div>


<h3>Term paper</h3>
<div class="section">

Students will also write a term paper in an area of research related to object-oriented software development and its offshoots. It can be a survey of several related research papers from research journals and other acceptable conferences or workshops. (Examples of acceptable conferences and workshops are the research tracks of OOPSLA, ECOOP, WOOR, FOOL, etc.)

<h2>Policy on late homeworks</h2>
<div class="section">

Late homeworks will get a 20% deduction per day, for each day past the due date.<p>

For online submissions, we will follow the time stamp as reported by Blackboard. For example, if the due date is Aug, 24, a submission on Aug. 25 12:01am will get a 20% deduction. <p>

Paper submissions must be handed directly to me on the day it is due.<p>

</div>

<h2>Academic Integrity</h2>
<div class="section">

Cheating will not be tolerated for project assignments, exams and other assignments. Consult the UNO Student Handbook and Department of Computer Science Policies and Procedures for formal policies about plagiarism.
