<title>Expected Project Documentation</title>
</head>

<body>

At the end of the semester, the expected project documentation to be submitted includes:
<ol>
<li>Final report
<li>Doxygen or equivalent generated documentation of module interfaces
<li>Final presentation
</ol>


Here's a generic outline for the final report (page estimates are approximate):
<ol>
<li> Introduction (3-5 pages) should have the following sections:
<ul>
<li> Motivation: talk about the motivations for, and objectives of, the project
<li> Related Applications: include a section that discusses similar projects and how they differ from this project
<li> CS Foundations: explain what makes your problem a CS problem, discuss the CS theories that underpin your application, or discuss the advanced computing technologies involved
<li> Context: discuss current situation in client's environment/context
<ul>
<li> Subject facet: introduces your application domain and defines important concepts in the client's universe of discourse
<li> Usage facet: how things get done now, who the key stakeholders are, etc.
<li> IT facet: other systems to interact with
<li> Development facet: other development constraints imposed by client
<li> Legal/ethical facet: discuss legal/ethical considerations for the application and how your final product addressed them
</ul>
</ul>


<li> Requirements (8-12 pages)
<ul>
<li> this chapter should help explain the client needs and the requirements that are supposed to satisfy those needs
<li> see Requirements outline for more details
</ul>

<li> Architecture and Design (8-12 pages)
<ul>
<li> this chapter should help explain why the code is designed the way it is
<li> the following should be described and modeled: architecture, modules and their relationships and interactions, database (if applicable) - we may have to iterate to get the desired details
<li> in the textual description, talk about the rationales for various design decisions and identify which code modules or components were reused (e.g., open source libraries, existing code from another project, etc.)
<li> some screenshots
<li> see Architecture and Design outline for more details
</ul>


<li> Implementation (2-3 pages)
<ul>
<li> discuss the overall directory structure of source code
<ul>
<li> list which files were:
<ul>
<li> blackbox reused from existing libraries or projects (identify the source)
<li> adapted and modified from existing libraries or projects (identify the source)
<li> auto-generated (identify the tool)
<li> written from scratch
</ul>
</ul>
<li> discuss various technical issues that cropped up in the process of writing the code
<ul>
<li> document the research done to understand and resolve the issues, including links to references and other resources used
</ul>
</ul>

<li> Testing (2-4 pages)
<ul>
<li> discuss the overall testing strategy followed
<li> discuss how realistic test data was obtained
<li> list the tests conducted (can also point to automated scripts in the code repository)
<li> discuss the test results
</ul>

<li> Summary (3-5 pages)
<ul>
<li> discuss who eventually ended up doing what
<li> discuss the risks that were identified at the start of the project, which ones became problematic and which ones did not, and what unanticipated problems cropped up
<li> summarize the project schedule, i.e., what was accomplished at each project milestone
<li> [individual] what you learned in this project; for example:
<ul>
<li> how had the project helped improve your understanding of CS-related principles, concepts or theories?
<li> how had your CS background helped with this project?
</ul>
<li> [individual or team] if you had the chance to do it over, what would you do differently
<li> based on your experience, suggest some future extensions
</ul>


<li> Local and Global Impacts (1 page)
<ul>
<li> discuss potential benefits to society - highlight the fact that computing applications have, to varying degrees, impacts to society (client organizations, local communities, business and industrial communities)
</ul>


<li> Appendices
<ol>
<li> Relevant URLs - Google folder, project tracker, code repository, API documentation, live demo (if applicable)
<li> Setup instructions - what I'd need to do to install your code from scratch and execute it
<li> Team weekly meeting notes
<li> Individual journals of weekly activities
<li> Email transcripts of discussions with clients
</ol>
</ol>


Instructions for the generated documentation:
<ul>
<li> Use Doxygen, unless you have a more suitable alternative for your implementation language(s).
<li> Recommended Doxygen settings: html only, optimize for language, generate call graphs
<li> Use a website or a service such as https://pages.github.com to host your generated documentation.
</ul>
