<h2>Description</h2>

A continuation of the study of software engineering with an emphasis on early phases of software development, namely requirements engineering/specification and design. Fundamentals of quality software design. In-depth study of various software requirements specification and design techniques. 

<h2>Learning Objectives</h2>

Students who complete this course will:
<ul>
<li> be familiar with the notion of a socio-technical context upon which software systems are deployed,
<li> have knowledge of process, methods, tools used in requirements engineering,
<li> understand the importance of software architecture,
<li> be able to apply the lessons learned to real-world software projects.
</ul>

<h2>Course content:</h2>

<ol>
<li> Socio-technical context
<li> Requirements engineering process
<li> Requirements modeling (informal and formal notations)
<li> Requirements validation 
<li> Software architecture and design 
<li> Advanced topics 
</ol>


<h3>Lectures</h3>

The updated lecture slides will be posted on Canvas.

<h3>Exam dates</h3>

<ol>
<li> Midterm - October 17
<li> Final - December 12 (in class)
</ol>

<h3>Project</h3>
Students will work in teams on a software engineering project. 

<h3>Research paper</h3>
Students are required to submit a 10-15 page, graduate-level research paper reviewing an area of requirements engineering research. 

<h3>Homeworks/Exercises</h3>
There will be several exercises which will put into practice the principles and techniques from the course lectures.

<h2>Policy on late homeworks</h2>

Late homeworks will get a 20% deduction per day, for each day past the due date.<p>

For online submissions, we will follow the time stamp as reported by Blackboard. For example, if the due date is Aug, 24, a submission on Aug. 25 12:01am will get a 20% deduction. <p>

Paper submissions must be handed directly to me on the day it is due.<p>

<h2>Academic Integrity</h2>

Cheating will not be tolerated for project assignments, exams and other assignments. For formal policies about cheating and plagiarism, consult the <a href="http://www.unomaha.edu/aandsaffairs/tabs/policies.php" target="new">UNO Student Policies</a> and <a href="/classes/CS-policies.pdf" target="new">Department of Computer Science Policies and Procedures</a>.
