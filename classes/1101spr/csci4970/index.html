<h2>Overview</h2>

The Capstone Project represents the crowning achievement of a Computer Science student's undergraduate experience,
enabling him or her to apply fundamental computer science principles to the solution of real-world problems. 
Students will employ software engineering techniques to develop the project in a systematic manner.


<h2>Prerequisites</h2>

<ul>
<li>Software engineering (CSCI 4830)
<li>Senior standing in CS
<li>Ability to work in a team
</ul>

<h2>Learning Objectives</h2>

Students who complete this course will:
<ol>
<li> Recognize and appreciate how fundamental computer science principles apply to real-world problems.
<li> Improve their communication skills through interaction with an actual client.
<li> Gain proficiency in modeling, implementing and testing nontrivial software applications.
<li> Gain more experience in working in teams.
</ol>

<h2>How it works</h2>

<ul>
<li> Students will form teams.
<li> Students will find and work with a client to develop a project proposal.
<li> Once the proposed project has been approved by the instructor and client, students will consult with the instructor and develop a project plan for delivering a final product acceptable to the client.
<li> Students will be accountable for meeting the planned milestones and reporting progress to the instructor and/or the client.
<li> Upon completion of the project, students will publicly present and demonstrate their work.
</ul>

In parallel, we will have lectures for the first few weeks. Topics covered include:
<ul>
<li> Team collaboration
<li> Review of requirements analysis and design models
<li> Test-first development 
<li> Version control
<li> Software analysis and testing
<li> Additional lectures specific to a project may also be provided
</ul>

<h2>Suitable Projects</h2>

While there are lots of possibilities to choose from, 
projects are expected to have a challenging algorithmic component requiring the nontrivial application of computer science principles. 
Example application types include scheduling, simulation, data mining, cyber-physical systems, and scientific computing.
Projects will usually involve sophisticated algorithms manipulating complex structures, and may involve overlapping areas such as language processing, networks, embedded systems, real-time systems, parallel computation, databases, artificial intelligence, computer graphics, etc. 


<h2>Evaluation</h2>

There are no exams or graded homeworks in this course. Students will be evaluated based on the quality of the project at the end of the semester. Evaluation rubrics will be provided at the start of the semester.
