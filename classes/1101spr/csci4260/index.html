<li> <i>Cost-Justifying Usability (2nd edition)</i> by Randolph Bias and Deborah Mayhew, Morgan Kaufmann, 2005.
</ul>

<h2>Learning Objectives</h2>

Students who complete this course should have knowledge of process, methods, tools used in user interface development and usability testing.

<h2>Lectures</h2>

(See BlackBoard for current list.)



<h2>Evaluation</h2>

Students taking the class as CSCI4260 will be evaluated as follows:

<table border=1>
<tr><td>Homeworks:</td><td align="right"> 20% </td></tr>
<tr><td>Projects:</td><td align="right"> 40% </td></tr>
<tr><td>Exams (midterm and final):</td><td align="right"> 35% </td></tr>
<tr><td>Class participation:</td><td align="right"> 5% </td></tr>
</table>
<p>

Students taking the class as CSCI8266 will be evaluated as follows:

<table border=1>
<tr><td>Homeworks:</td><td align="right"> 10% </td></tr>
<tr><td>Projects:</td><td align="right"> 35% </td></tr>
<tr><td>Exams (midterm and final):</td><td align="right"> 35% </td></tr>
<tr><td>Class participation:</td><td align="right"> 5% </td></tr>
<tr><td>Research paper:</td><td align="right"> 15% </td></tr>
</table>


<h3>Homeworks</h3>

Most homeworks will revolve around readings of book chapters from The Design of Everyday Things. The book will be used for in class discussions of design principles. A writeup is to be submitted before every discussion.


<h3>Project</h3>

The semester project is intended to put into practice the interface design principles learned throughout the course. The project can be any application as long as:
<ul>
<li> it involves significant/nontrivial user interaction or presents a challenging usability problem.
<li> you have access to several types of prospective users to interview and test out the prototype.
</ul>

<h3>Exams</h3>

Approximate exam dates:
<ul>
<li> Midterm - mid-March
<li> Finals - early May
</ul>

<h3>Graduate Student Research Paper</h3>

Students taking the class as CSCI8266 will also write a paper on an advanced topic in a user interface research area. Each student must also make a 20-minute presentation on their paper near the end of the semester.


<h3>Guidelines for assessing class participation</h3>

<table border=1>
<tr><th>Grade</th><th>Description</th></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Regularly makes helpful, relevant contributions to lecture discussions.<br>Offers observations that challenges classmates to think about the material in new ways.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Attends regularly and occasionally makes helpful, relevant contributions to lecture discussions.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Attends regularly and actively pays attention to discussion. </td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Attends regularly but does not pay attention to discussion. </td></tr>
<tr><td>1</td><td>Does not attend regularly.</td></tr>
<tr><td>0</td><td>Misses most classes.</td></tr>

<h2>Policy on late homeworks</h2>

<ul>
<li> <strong>For chapter summaries to be used in class discussions:</strong> Late submissions will receive a 50% deduction per day if submitted after the class discussions have been conducted.
<li> <strong>For other types of homeworks (if any):</strong> Late submissions will get a 20% deduction per day, for each day past the due time (as timestamped on Blackboard).
<li> Paper submissions must be handed directly to me on the day it is due.
</ul>

<h2>Academic Integrity</h2>

Cheating will not be tolerated for project assignments, exams and other assignments.
