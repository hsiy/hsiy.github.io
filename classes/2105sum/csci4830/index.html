<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The course focuses on the engineering and development of real-world software products. It provides a pragmatic introduction into the fundamentals of software engineering. Basics of software project management are presented and are practiced in the term project.</p>
<h2>Learning Objectives</h2>
<p>Students who complete this course will be able to:</p>
<ul>
    <li>understand the processes, methods, tools used in the software engineering profession,</li>
    <li>apply engineering practices to software project management,</li>
    <li>formulate software requirements for a given project need,</li>
    <li>design and create small and medium-sized software applications.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Course content:</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Overview and motivations</li>
    <li>Requirements analysis</li>
    <li>Software design</li>
    <li>Verification and Validation</li>
    <li>Software evolution</li>
    <li>Project management</li>
    <li>Advanced topics</li>
</ol>
<h3>How the online course works</h3>
<p><strong>Meetings:</strong> We will meet via Zoom on the first Thursday, 5/20, from 6pm to set up the teams. For the remaining weeks, the Thursday evening time should be used for team face-to-face meetings via Zoom.</p>
<p><strong>Homepage:</strong> The homepage will provide a starting point for each week's activities. Be sure to check it often.</p>
<p><strong>Asynchronous Instruction:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>Lectures will be asynchronous. Lecture slides from the textbook will be posted in advance.</li>
    <li>Each week, there will be one or more assignments that will be due on Wednesday evening at 11:59pm. These assignments will mostly be on the readings expected for that week. Expect to spend at least 2 hours per week doing the online readings and exercises.</li>
    <li>I will post short video lectures on Thursday evenings, addressing some key points from that week's readings and answering some of the questions from the reading assignments.</li>
</ul>
