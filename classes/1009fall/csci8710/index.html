<h2>Course Description:</h2>
<div class="section">

Designed to introduce students to advanced object technology and other modern methodologies for developing software systems. Intended for graduate students who have mastered the basic concepts and issues of software engineering. Course covers advanced object-oriented software development. The course also covers several offshoots of object technology, including: component-based software engineering, aspect-oriented software development, model-driven software development, software product line engineering, service-oriented computing, generative programming, etc.


</div>

<h2>Evaluation</h2>
<div class="section">

Students will be evaluated as follows:

<table border=1>
<tr><td>Exams (midterm and final)</td><td align="right"> 40% </td></tr>
<tr><td>Projects and papers</td><td align="right"> 50% </td></tr>
<tr><td>Homeworks</td><td align="right"> 5% </td></tr>

</table>

</div>

<h2>Approximate exam dates</h2>
<div class="section">

<ol>
<li> Midterm - mid-October
<li> Final - mid-December
</ol>

</div>

<h2>Projects and Papers</h2>
<div class="section">

Projects and papers will be given to extend the students' learning experience beyond just class lectures. These consists of student presentations, exercises, and a term project or paper.

<h3> Technology demonstrations </h3>
<div class="section">
A technology demonstration gives a brief (20-minute) overview of a modern software development technology relevant to the course. Students can present an introduction to, say, the architecture of Oracle Fusion Middleware and prepare a brief demo illustrating its salient features.  Students must be prepared to answer questions about the technology (e.g., what makes it work, how is it different from its competitors, etc). Preferably, the demo should be live, although screenshots or videos are also possible in cases where it is difficult to access the installations. I will be providing a list of <a href="http://www.cs.unomaha.edu/~hsiy/classes/1009fall/csci8710/techs.html">technology areas</a> for this semester.
</div>


<h3>Exercises</h3>
<div class="section">

There will also be 3-4 exercises or short projects which will put into practice the software development principles from the course. Note that programming exercises may require working knowledge of Java EE or .Net with C#.
</div>


<h3>Term project</h3>
<div class="section">

Students will develop a term project showcasing technologies covered in class. Term projects can be developed in teams of up to 3 persons.

</div>

<h3>Term paper</h3>
<div class="section">

As an alternative to the term project, students can also elect to write a term paper in an area of research related to object-oriented software development and its offshoots. It can be a survey of several related research papers from research journals and other acceptable conferences or workshops. (Examples of acceptable conferences and workshops are the research tracks of OOPSLA, ECOOP, GPCE, ICSE, FSE, etc.)

<h2>Policy on late homeworks</h2>
<div class="section">

Unless otherwise stated, homeworks must be completed before class on the day it is due. 
<p>

Late homeworks will get a 20% deduction per day, for each 24-hour period past the due time.<p>

</div>

<h2>Academic Integrity</h2>
<div class="section">

Cheating will not be tolerated for project assignments, exams and other assignments. Consult the <a href="http://www.unomaha.edu/aandsaffairs/insidepages/studentpolicies.php">UNO Student Policies</a> and Department of Computer Science Policies and Procedures for formal policies about cheating and plagiarism.
