<h2>Overview</h2>

<b>Practicum</b> - \&#x2C8;prak-ti-k&#x259;m\ - a course of study involving supervised practical application of previously studied theory. (Adapted from the Merriam-Webster Dictionary.)

<h3>Description</h3>
This course provides students an opportunity to practice software engineering skills and principles in a real world setting. Students work in teams on projects provided by real clients. They will have the opportunity to develop production-quality software using modern technologies and development environments. Students will have project management deadlines and will be accountable for assignments and reporting progress to the client.
<p>

For Fall 2009, our client is <a href="http://www.mutualofomaha.com" target="_blank"><b>Mutual of Omaha</b></a>.

<h3>How it works</h3>

<ul>
<li> The instructor and the students will decide on a suitable lecture time at the start of the semester.
<li> Students will meet with the instructor at the beginning of the semester to discuss ground rules and expectations for the project.
<li> After a few initial lectures, the rest of the semester will be devoted to completing a project with Mutual of Omaha. The instructor will function as a consultant to the project. 
<li> Once students have been briefed by Mutual of Omaha on the project, students will consult with instructor and develop a plan for accomplishing the project.
<li> Instructor will monitor progress of the project through weekly log submissions, updates to the project plan and prototype demonstrations. If necessary, instructor may call a project meeting with the student team.
<li> Upon completion of the project, students will present and demonstrate their work to the instructor and to Mutual of Omaha. 
</ul>

<h2>Prerequisites</h2>

<h3>Proficiency in Java</h3>
The implementation of the project will be in Java. It is expected that mastery of Java as taught in CSCI 1620 will be sufficient. Additional lectures on Java-based technologies will supplement the student's knowledge of Java.

<h3>Software engineering (optional)</h3>
Ideally, students should have completed CSCI 4830 (Introduction to Software Engineering) and would have been exposed to team projects and real-world issues of software development. For those who have not taken CSCI 4830, the practicum course lectures will include reviews of the material in software engineering.  

<h3>Ability to work in a team</h3>
Crucial to the successful completion of this project is the ability of students to work as a team, including the willingness to see other points of view, the ability to communicate with managers, mentors and peers, and the adoption of a professional attitude and work ethic.

<h2>Learning Objectives</h2>

Students who complete this course will:
<ul>
<li>	Gain experience in eliciting and analyzing client requirements. 
<li>	Develop communication skills through interaction with client.
<li>	Become proficient at building models of software components.
<li>	Become proficient at maintaining and managing changes to software.
<li>	Practice reading and understanding software written by someone else.
<li>	Become proficient at planning incremental extensions to software.
<li>	Become disciplined at creating and running tests. 
<li>	Learn to work in teams.
<li>	Become exposed to project management principles.
</ul>

<h2>Course content:</h2>

Topics covered include:
<ol>
<li> Team collaboration
<li> Requirements analysis 
<li> Design models
<li> Test-first development 
<li> Version control
<li> Source code analysis 
<li> Code inspections 
</ol>

Mutual of Omaha engineers will also provide lectures on Java-based technologies (J2EE, Struts, JSP, servlets, portlets, etc.) and software development using IBM tools and frameworks (Rational Application Developer, WebSphere Portal).  

<h2>Evaluation</h2>

There are no exams or graded homeworks in this course. Students will be evaluated based on the quality of the project at the end of the semester. Evaluation rubrics will be provided at the start of the semester.

<h2>Internship Application</h2>

Mutual of Omaha is offering paid internships to students working on this project. Thus, to register for this course, an internship application is necessary. Applicants will go through the interview process with Mutual. Once a student has been selected for one of these internship positions, he/she will be cleared to register for the course. 
<p>

The internship position description is available at <a href="http://www.mutualofomaha.com/careers"  target="_blank">http://www.mutualofomaha.com/careers</a> (Job Number: 015924).
