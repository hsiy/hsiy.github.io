<h2>Course Description:</h2>
<div class="section">

Designed to introduce students to advanced object technology and other modern methodologies for developing software systems. Intended for graduate students who have mastered the basic concepts and issues of software engineering. Course covers advanced object-oriented software development. The course also covers several offshoots of object technology, including: component-based software engineering, aspect-oriented software development, model-driven software development, software product line engineering, service-oriented computing, generative programming, etc.

</div>

<h2>Approximate exam dates</h2>
<div class="section">

<ol>
<li> Midterm - mid-October
<li> Final - mid-December
</ol>

</div>

<h2>Projects and Papers</h2>
<div class="section">

Projects and papers will be given to extend the students' learning experience beyond just class lectures. These consists of student presentations, projects, and a term paper.

<h3> Student presentations </h3>
<div class="section">

Throughout the semester, there will be several student presentations and development projects. Each student will be expected to give a presentation, which can either be a technology briefing or research paper discussion. 

<h4> Technology briefings </h4>
<div class="section">
A technology briefing gives an overview of a current software development technology relevant to the course. Students can volunteer to present an introduction to, say, the architecture of Oracle Fusion Middleware.  Note that a student wishing to make a technology briefing <b>must</b> have professional experience with that technology. I will be providing a list of <a href="http://www.cs.unomaha.edu/~hsiy/classes/0909fall/csci8710/techs.html">technology areas</a> for this semester.
</div>


<h4> Research paper presentations </h4>
<div class="section">
Alternately, students can also present for discussion the results of an acceptable research paper from a relevant journal or conference. I will be providing a list of <a href="http://www.cs.unomaha.edu/~hsiy/classes/0909fall/csci8710/respapers.html">papers</a> you can choose from.
</div>

</div>

<h3>Projects</h3>
<div class="section">

There will also be 3-4 development projects which will put into practice the software development principles from the course. Note that programming projects may require working knowledge of Java EE or .Net with C#.
</div>


<h3>Term paper</h3>
<div class="section">

Students will also write a term paper in an area of research related to object-oriented software development and its offshoots. It can be a survey of several related research papers from research journals and other acceptable conferences or workshops. (Examples of acceptable conferences and workshops are the research tracks of OOPSLA, ECOOP, WOOR, FOOL, etc.)

<h2>Guidelines for assessing class participation</h2>
<div class="section">

<table border=1>
<tr><th>Grade</th><th>Description</th></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Regularly makes helpful, relevant contributions to lecture discussions.<br>Offers observations that challenges classmates to think about the material in new ways.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Attends regularly and occasionally makes helpful, relevant contributions to lecture discussions.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Attends regularly and actively pays attention to discussion. </td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Attends regularly but does not pay attention to discussion. </td></tr>
<tr><td>1</td><td>Does not attend regularly.</td></tr>
<tr><td>0</td><td>Misses most classes.</td></tr>

<h2>Policy on late homeworks</h2>
<div class="section">

Unless otherwise stated, homeworks must be completed before class on the day it is due. 
<p>

Late homeworks will get a 20% deduction per day, for each 24-hour period past the due time.<p>

</div>

<h2>Academic Integrity</h2>
<div class="section">

Cheating will not be tolerated for project assignments, exams and other assignments. Consult the UNO Student Handbook and Department of Computer Science Policies and Procedures for formal policies about plagiarism.
