<h2>Description</h2>

<p>The early stages in a software engineering project are often dominated by one question, what should we build? To address this question, software engineers engage in two activities, requirements engineering, which produces an organized body of necessary information about the product to be built, and architectural design, which produces a blueprint for how an acceptable product might be realized in software. Though distinct, these activities are typically intertwined (the so-called "twin peaks"). Architecture cannot exist without requirements, and some information needed by requirements engineering may not be obtainable without knowledge of the architecture.</p>
<p>This course is a continuation of the study of software engineering with an emphasis on these early activities of software development. Practical processes of requirements engineering and architectural design are included, as well as formal specifications of software systems. Other topics such as relevant metrics and support tools are also discussed.</p>

<h2>Learning Objectives</h2>
<p>On completion of this course, students will be able to:</p>
<ul>
<li>analyze the socio-technical context within which a software system is deployed.</li>
<li>apply the processes, methods, tools used in requirements engineering and software architecture practice.</li>
<li>develop a literature review of an area of requirements engineering or software architecture research.</li>
<li>express formal specifications of software systems.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Course content:</h2>
<ol>
<li>Socio-technical context</li>
<li>Requirements engineering process</li>
<li>Requirements modeling (informal and formal notations)</li>
<li>Non-functional requirements and quality attributes</li>
<li>Architecturally significant requirements</li>
<li>Architectural views</li>
</ol>

<h2>Instructional Approach</h2>
<p>This course is being offered in person. Lectures will be flipped, that is, lecture slides and videos, and homeworks are provided in advance of the meeting. The class meeting time itself will be used for discussion and recap, and to give you time to work on the project and paper as needed. The Canvas home page is your guide to the activities expected for each week. The posted slides on the homepage will be the primary source of lecture information. Rather than reading off of the information that are in the slides, my videos will give a preview of what to look for in the lecture slides. </p>

<h3>Exam dates</h3>

<ol>
<li> Midterm - October 13
<li> Final - December 15
</ol>

<h3>Project</h3>
<p>In place of a big semester-long team-based project, for this semester, you will work on 4 small projects. Project 1 will focus on requirements specification. Project 2 will focus on tool support for requirements engineering and/or architecture design. Project 3 will focus on understanding software architecture. Project 4 will focus on formal specification.</p>


<h3>Research paper</h3>
Students are required to submit a research paper that consists of a mini-literature review of an area in requirements engineering or software architecture research. 

<h3>Homeworks/Exercises</h3>
There will be several exercises which will put into practice the principles and techniques from the course lectures.

<h2>Academic Integrity</h2>

Cheating will not be tolerated for project assignments, exams and other assignments.
